C++ Metaprogramming library enabling full static checking and register abstraction in embedded software

This repository is still in an early phase! Public interfaces could still be volatile and not everything has been tested yet. If you are interested in helping or checking out what is being built here have a look at the wiki.

To use the library simply pull the folder Lib and add it to your compilers include paths (-I directive). Be sure and set your compiler dialect to C++11 at least.
